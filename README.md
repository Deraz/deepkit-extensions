Experimental extensions to modify [Deepkit's](http://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework) default behaviors or to be used alongside it.

We're very early in our process of migrating to [Deepkit](http://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework) from our our [internal non-TS framework](https://github.com/signal24/node-server-foundation).
Feel free to use anything from this package, but expect breaking changes if you depend directly on the package.
